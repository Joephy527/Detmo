# detmo web application frontend
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

    The main branch is ```skgdevErnest```

### Create a local env file in the root folder
1. Name the file - ".env.local"
2. Contents of the local file needs to be the content of this doc - [`Contents of Local file`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wt7uiUY3NrpTHQF_qjOE1DsfnbLjfRt_JnzLrGuNuGY/edit?usp=sharing) - You can request access to this doc. 

### Install all dependencies, Build the code and run the dev server

```
npm i --force
npm run build
npm run dev
```
### View the application on localhost
1. Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
2. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
